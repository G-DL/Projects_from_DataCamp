# Projects_from_DataCamp
This is a collection of guided projects that I have developed as part of the curriculum for Data Scientist.
The curriculum is one of the courses offered by the company DataCamp, at www.datacamp.com
The projects consist of a variety of tasts related to analysis of data in multiple disciplines, including finance, medicine, demography, etc. It was fun and instructive to write them, and I can reccommend to those interested in learning about data analysis to join the related courses.

##DISCLAIMER:
For all the projects contained in this repository, the cells in markdown were given as part of the task instruction and I do not claim ownership over them, while the code itself was written by me. To clarify again: the task and its description were drafted by the staff of DataCamp, and the specific solution to the task was implemented in code by me. This disclaimer applies for all the projects contained here in this repository.
